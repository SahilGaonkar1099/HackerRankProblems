#You have a record of  students. Each record contains the student's name, and their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry.
#The marks can be floating values. The user enters some integer  followed by the names and marks for  students. 
#You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. The user then enters a student's name. 
#Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal places.
#CODE:

N=int(input()) #take the interger input
listHelp=[];marks={} #list for help and the required dictionary
for i in range(N):iterate through the number of students to take the next inputs and append those inputs to list
    listHelp.append(input())
QueryString=input()#this is for the required output 
for i in listHelp:#iterate through the list which has lines as the items seperated by commas
    sum=0.0
    for j in i.split():#iterate through string by converting it to list for simplicity
        if j.isalpha():#gives boolean value checking for word or int
            m=j
        else:
            sum+=float(j)    
    marks[m]=format(float(sum/3),'.2f')#.2f is the format specifier which gives two numbers after the decimal point.
print(marks[QueryString])
